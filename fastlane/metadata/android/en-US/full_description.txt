<p><b>ZukuLock</b> is a lightweight Android application that allows you to quickly toggle the screen on or off with a single tap. The app utilizes Shizuku to execute the <code>input keyevent 26</code> command, mimicking the physical power button. This is particularly useful for reducing wear and tear on your power button or adding convenience to screen control.</p><p>This app was initially designed for <b>Google Pixel devices</b>, which lack the <b>double-tap-to-lock</b> feature. Most screen lock apps require <b>Accessibility permissions</b>, but enabling Accessibility can lead to certain banking apps in Vietnam (and possibly others globally) blocking access for security reasons. <b>ZukuLock</b> offers a workaround by avoiding Accessibility permissions, allowing you to use banking apps seamlessly.</p><p><br><b>Key Features</b></p><ul><li><b>Quick Screen Toggle:</b> Acts as a virtual power button.</li><li><b>Shizuku Integration:</b> Leverages system-level permissions without requiring root access.</li><li><b>No UI Interruption:</b> Simply tap the app icon to execute the action without launching any additional windows.</li><li><b>Customizable Gestures:</b> Works with launchers like Lawnchair or Nova Launcher to enable double-tap gestures for locking the screen.</li></ul>
